> Docker also known as containerization gives as a great opportunity to run automated tests in a more effective way. Containers give us entire portable runtime environment with libraries, dependencies, binaries and configuration files in one package. The goal of this session is to understand what Docker is and how it works, learn how to create and reuse Docker images and how to apply containerization approach for existing tests.
